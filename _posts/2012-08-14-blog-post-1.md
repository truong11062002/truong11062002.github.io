## Introduction

Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used in machine learning and various other fields. It plays a crucial role in training models, minimizing cost functions, and finding optimal solutions. In this blog post, we'll delve into the concept of gradient descent, exploring its importance and applications.

### What is Gradient Descent?

Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a model. In the context of machine learning, the cost function represents the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. The goal of gradient descent is to find the optimal parameters (weights and biases) that minimize this cost.

## How Gradient Descent Works

The algorithm starts with an initial set of parameters and iteratively adjusts them to minimize the cost function. The key idea behind gradient descent is to move in the direction of steepest decrease in the cost function. This direction is determined by the negative gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters.

### Iterative Optimization

At each iteration, the parameters are updated based on the gradient and a learning rate. The learning rate controls the size of the steps taken during optimization. A too small learning rate may lead to slow convergence, while a too large learning rate may cause overshooting.

## Types of Gradient Descent

There are different variants of gradient descent, each with its own characteristics:

### 1. Batch Gradient Descent

In batch gradient descent, the entire dataset is used to compute the gradient of the cost function. It provides accurate updates but can be computationally expensive for large
