As a bachelor's degree in computer science at UIT, where I have been involved in several research projects and publications related to object detection and classification. As a research assistant at UIT-Together Research Group, I have contributed to the co-authorship of two international papers, one of which introduced a novel Vietnamese fruit image dataset and a SVM classification model. I have also obtained multiple certifications from Kaggle on Machine Learning, Data Visualization, and SQL.

My goal is to deepen my understanding and skills in Machine Learning and apply them into real-life, and to explore new and innovative ways to leverage them for social good. I am eager to learn from experts and peers in the field, and to collaborate with diverse and talented teams.
